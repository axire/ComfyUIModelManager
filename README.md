# ComfyUI Model Manager
A simple tool that combines **model repos**, **comfyUI installs** and **safeTensor inspector**. 

## Model repos and ComfyUI
This tools makes it handy to manage models of any kind of different architectures. FLUX, SDXL, SD1.5, Stable cascade. 
With a few clicks you can change comfyUI to only show FLUX or SDXL or SD1.5 or any way of sorting your models. 
There are folders that holds the models, i.e. **models repos**. 
There are folders that holds ComfyUI installation, i.e. **ComfyUI Installs**.
This model manager can link them in any combination. Run this tool to do the config. No need to keep it running. The models will still be available. :)

## Safetensot inspector
Need help understanding the .safetensor files?
All those downloaded .safesonsor files. Do you need help sorting them? Is it a SD1.5 checkpoint? Or was it a FLUX LORA? Maybe it was a contolnet!
Use the **safeTensor inspector**.

## Storage Architecture / Folder structure

### Repository Structure
You can organize your model repositories in different ways depending on your needs:

#### Option 1: By Model Architecture
Create separate repositories for different model architectures. This keeps models organized by compatibility and makes it easy to link only relevant models to specific ComfyUI installations.

```
/mnt/storage/ai/models-flux/
├── checkpoints/
├── loras/
├── embeddings/
├── controlnets/
├── vae/
└── upscale_models/

/mnt/storage/ai/models-sdxl/
├── checkpoints/
├── loras/
├── embeddings/
├── controlnets/
├── vae/
└── upscale_models/

/mnt/storage/ai/models-sd15/
├── checkpoints/
├── loras/
├── embeddings/
├── controlnets/
├── vae/
└── upscale_models/
```

#### Option 2: By Content Style/Purpose
Organize repositories by the type of content or artistic style. This approach is useful when you have specialized workflows or want to keep certain model collections separate.

```
/mnt/storage/ai/models-cartoons/
├── checkpoints/
├── loras/
├── embeddings/
├── controlnets/
├── vae/
└── upscale_models/

/mnt/storage/ai/models-photos/
├── checkpoints/
├── loras/
├── embeddings/
├── controlnets/
├── vae/
└── upscale_models/

/mnt/storage/ai/models-paintings/
├── checkpoints/
├── loras/
├── embeddings/
├── controlnets/
├── vae/
└── upscale_models/
```

#### Option 3: Mixed Approach
If you are really nerdy, combine both approaches - organize by architecture first, then by content within each architecture:

```
/mnt/storage/ai/flux-models/
├── realistic/
│   ├── checkpoints/
│   └── loras/
├── anime/
│   ├── checkpoints/
│   └── loras/
└── artistic/
    ├── checkpoints/
    └── loras/
```

### ComfyUI Installation Structure  
This is the standard, ComfyUI installation structure. The tool manages the models subfolders:
```
/home/user/ComfyUI/
├── models/          ← Tool creates symbolic links here
│   ├── checkpoints/ → /mnt/storage/ai/models/checkpoints/
│   ├── loras/       → /mnt/storage/ai/models/loras/
│   └── ...
├── web/
├── comfy/
└── main.py
```

## Setup / Installation

### Linux/macOS Setup
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
chmod +x start_model_manager.sh
./start_model_manager.sh
```

### Windows Setup
```batch
setup.bat
start_model_manager.bat
```

### Configuration
Copy the example configuration and customize for your setup:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
cp model_manager_config.example.json model_manager_config.json
```

**Windows:**
```batch
copy model_manager_config.example.json model_manager_config.json
```

Then edit `model_manager_config.json` with your actual paths.

### Access Application
Navigate to: **http://localhost:8002**

## Getting Started - 3 Simple Steps

### Step 1: Add Your Model Repositories 📚
Set up your central model storage locations - where your actual files live.

![Add Repository](assets/screenshots/Closeup_AddRepository.png)

**Example**: `/mnt/storage/ai/models`
- Contains your actual model files (.safetensors, .ckpt, etc.)
- Organized in standard ComfyUI folder structure

### Step 2: Add Your ComfyUI Installations 🖥️
Register each ComfyUI installation that should access shared models.

![Add Installation](assets/screenshots/Closeup_AddInstallation.png)

**Example**: `/home/user/ComfyUI`
- Point to ComfyUI root directory
- Tool automatically manages the models subfolder

### Step 3: Link Repositories to Installations 🔗
Connect repositories to installations to create symbolic links.

![Link Repository](assets/screenshots/Closeup_LinkRepoInstall.png)

**Result**:
- Repository folders → ComfyUI model folders
- Automatic symbolic link creation
- Status monitoring and health checks

## SafeTensor Inspector

This is where the project started, it was just downhill from there. 

### Quick Access Shortcuts
![Quick Access](assets/screenshots/Closeup_Safetensor_QuickAccess.png)

Instantly navigate to any repository or installation with one click.

### Advanced Metadata Analysis
![Metadata Analysis](assets/screenshots/Closeup_Safetensor_Metedata.png)

Extract comprehensive information from SafeTensor files:
- **Key Parameters**: Base model, steps, precision
- **Full Headers**: Complete metadata inspection  
- **Tensor Keys**: Detailed tensor structure

## Benefits

### **Eliminate Duplication**
- Store models once, access from multiple ComfyUI installations
- Save disk space and reduce sync overhead

### **Smart Linking** 
- Automatic symbolic link creation and management
- Easy recreation if links breaks, for example after reboots

### **Comprehensive Analysis**
- Deep SafeTensor metadata inspection
- Quick navigation between management and analysis

### **Easy Organization**
- Visual interface for all operations
